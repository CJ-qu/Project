This is a simple and classic number guessing game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Test your intuition by trying to guess the secret number chosen by the computer!

## How to Play

The rules are simple:

1.  The computer will think of a secret number between **1 and 20**.
2.  Enter your guess in the input box and click the **"Check!"** button.
3.  The game will give you a hint, telling you if your guess is **too high ðŸ“ˆ** or **too low ðŸ“‰**.
4.  You start with a score of **20**. Each incorrect guess will cost you one point.
5.  If you guess the correct number before your score runs out, you win! Your score will be saved as the **highscore** if it's your best yet.
6.  Click the **"Again!"** button to reset the game and try for a new highscore.
